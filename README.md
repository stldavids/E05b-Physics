Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

main1.py is a program that simulates gravity by making the balls fall.
main2.py also simulates gravity, but also gives the balls a bounce
main3.py features animals that, when they bounce together, will speed up in their movement.  When they collide with the margins, they will slow down slightly with friction.
